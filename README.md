### Auto Repair Shop Database
## About
Running an auto repair shop has unique specifics that other businesses don't, such as technical knowledge, but the foundation is the same as any enterprise. In addition to providing good service, the car business requires good presentation, good customer service, and management knowledge. It is a daily challenge that requires the owner's commitment. Thus, the auto repair shop recognized the need to create and maintain a database to aid in data-driven decision making. The particular data for the company includes:

A system to control and manage the execution of service orders in an auto repair shop.
Customers bring vehicles to the repair shop for repairs or periodic maintenance.
Each vehicle is assigned to a team of mechanics who identify the services to be performed and fill out a service order with a delivery date.
From the service order, the cost of each service is calculated by consulting a labor reference table.
The cost of each part will also be included in the service order.
The customer authorizes the execution of the services.
The same team evaluates and executes the services.
A service order can include various types of parts, and a part can be included in more than one service order.
